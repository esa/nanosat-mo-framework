# NanoSat MO Framework

The [NanoSat MO Framework] is a software framework for nanosatellites based on CCSDS Mission Operations services.

It introduces the concept of apps in space that can be started and stopped from ground. Apps can retrieve data from the platform through a set of well-defined MO services. Many possibilities for extensions are available due to its modular and flexible design approach which is not limited to the space segment but extends down to ground by providing all the building blocks for a complete and free end-to-end solution.

A Software Development Kit (SDK) is available in order to facilitate the development with the [NanoSat MO Framework].

The research was carried by Graz University of Technology in partnership with the European Space Agency.

## Release
The latest NMF SDK release tag can be downloaded in [Releases]. However, the currently recommended distribution channel is directly from Git repository.

## Getting Started

### Building

Prerequisites:

- Java SDK 1.8 (Build will not work on JDK 9 and above as of now)
- Apache Maven

Clone this repository, set the environment variable NMF\_HOME with the path to this repository's root directory and run `mvn install` in the root directory.

Note that the errors about missing module descriptors during Javadoc generation are to be expected and non breaking.

In order to produce independently runnable Java executables (JAR artifacts with dependencies - equivalent of statically linked executables), use `mvn install -P assembly-with-dependencies`.

### SDK and examples

More documentation about code examples, SDK packaging and usage is available under [sdk](sdk) directory.

### Logging

This project uses the default Java logger (java.util.Logger) to generate log messages. The verbosity of these log messages can be changed by configuring the logging.properties file inside the NMF\_HOME directory.
