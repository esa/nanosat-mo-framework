/**
 * COMConfiguration tracks COM model relationships.
 * <p>
 * COM model is the Identity - Definition - Instance - Status relationship, where Identity, Definition, Instance, Status are COM Objects.
 * <p>
 * The Related links are normally Status -> Instance, Instance -> Definition, and Definition -> Identity.
 * The Inverse Related links are in the opposite direction (e.g. Identity -> Definition).
 * They are represented by "configuration" COM objects, since there are no Inverse Related links in COM Model.
 * <p>
 * Example: ..IdentityTo..Definition configuration COM Object has Related link pointing to Definition and body is the Identity,
 * so the meaning is Identity -> Definition.
