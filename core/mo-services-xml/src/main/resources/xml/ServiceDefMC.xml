            comment="This section details the MC services, the structures used by the services are detailed in section 4. Both the services and structures are defined in terms of the MO MAL, which is defined in [2], so it is possible to deploy them over any supported protocol and message transport.&#xA;The services defined here are also specified in terms of the COM, which is defined in [3].&#xA;To aid comprehension, several tables are included for each service and operation definition. The table formats are briefly described in section 1.6.3.2 and are the same as those used for the specification of the MO COM services in [3]. &#xA;All service specifications in this document are part of the MC area, which has a short form number of '4'.">

                 comment="The action service allows consumers to submit an action for execution and to subsequently monitor the execution progress of these actions via the COM activity tracking pattern. The progress of the action is split into two parts, firstly transfer from the consumer to the provider, and secondly execution in the provider.&#xA;An action is submitted to the provider using the submitAction operation, the progress of which can be monitored using the COM activity tracking pattern, which completes when the action has been delivered to the provider. The action is then executed in the provider which can also be monitored using the activity tracking pattern. The submitAction operation takes the object instance identifier of the submitted action and uses that to populate the source fields of the activity tracking events. Coordination may be required between action service consumers to ensure the action object instance identifiers are unique. How this is done is outside the scope of this specification however a good approach is the use of a central COM archive as that can provide the unique instance identifiers.&#xA;The nominal sequence of action submission and execution monitoring are shown in Figure 3-1:&#xA; insert sequence diag here &#xA;The consumer is responsible for creating and archiving the action instance object and then using the submitAction operation to submit it to the action provider for execution. The action provider reports, using the COM ActivityTracking service, both the execution progress of the submitAction operation and also the execution of the action itself. Once the supplied action instance details have been checked and execution of the action started by the submitAction operation, that operation finishes, whilst the execution of the action possibly continues (depends on the actual action). The final interaction in the sequence shows the execution events of the executing action instance, the '*' at the start of that line indicates zero to many events being published.&#xA;If the execution of an action fails with an error, the action service provider can publish an ActionFailure COM event to hold the error code being reported by the failure. If no error code is required to be reported then there is no need to publish the event as the normal COM ActivityTracking event contains a success indication.&#xA;The service also includes an operation, preCheckAction, which checks that an action would be accepted for execution without actually submitting it for execution. It is expected to be provided by local action proxies, rather than the remote system, to allow for localised checking of things such as link state, argument values, action safety, before sending the action over long and slow space links.&#xA;The action service defines three types of objects, the first type is the ActionIdentity object that holds the name of an action. The second type is the ActionDefinition object that holds the description of an action with the list of required/optional arguments. The third type is the ActionInstance object that holds details of a specific action instance namely a value for each of the arguments of the action.">

&lt;/ol&gt;
The validity of parameter shall be calculated against validity criteria in the parameter definition.
It shall be possible to update, delete, and add parameter definitions.
The list of the parameters definitions may be requested.</mal:documentation>
      <mal:documentation name="Functional Requirements" order="2">The generation of reports of the parameter shall be controlled by the generationEnabled Boolean value in the ParameterDefinitionDetails.
Setting the generationEnabled field to TRUE shall enable generation of reports for a specific parameter.
If a parameter is required to send periodic reports then the time between these reports shall be controlled using the reportInterval Duration value in the ParameterDefinitionDetails.
A reportInterval value of '0' shall mean no periodic reports shall be sent; reports must be triggered by another implementation-specific mechanism in this case.
The generationEnabled values can be set by using the enableGeneration operation.
The generationEnabled and reportInterval values can be set by using the updateDefinition operation.
For onboard parameters, the interval should be a multiple of the minimum sampling interval of those parameters.
If an interval that is not supported by the provider is requested, then an INVALID error shall be returned, and the change rejected.
If the parameter is periodic and reported via a periodic aggregation, and a new report has not been received in the aggregation period, then the validity shall be set to EXPIRED by setting the ParameterValue validityState field to '1'.
If the parameter raw value cannot be obtained, or calculated for synthetic parameters, then the validity state shall be INVALID_RAW by setting the ParameterValue validityState field to '2' and the rawValue set to NULL.
If the validityExpression field is NULL, or the validity expression evaluates to TRUE, and the ParameterDefinitionDetails either does not contain a conversion or the conversion is successful, then the validity state shall be set to VALID by setting the ParameterValue validityState field to '0'.
If the validityExpression field is NULL, or the validity expression evaluates to TRUE, and the conversion of the parameter value fails (for example an unexpected value for a discrete conversion), then the validity state shall be INVALID_CONVERSION by setting the ParameterValue validityState field to '3'.
If the validityExpression field is not NULL and the parameters used to determine the expression are not VALID, then the validity state shall be set to UNVERIFIED by setting the ParameterValue validityState field to '4'.
If the validityExpression field is not NULL and the validity expression evaluates to FALSE, then the validity state shall be set to INVALID by setting the ParameterValue validityState field to '5'.
If the validity of the parameter is INVALID_CONVERSION then the convertedValue of the ParameterValue shall be set to NULL.
If the validity of the parameter is either UNVERIFIED or INVALID and the ParameterDefinitionDetails contains a conversion, then the convertedValue of the ParameterValue shall contain the converted value.
It is supported that other, implementation specific, mechanisms may be used to determine parameter validity.
It is supported that other, deployment specific, validityState values be used however the meaning of those values is deployment specific and outside the scope of this standard. They must use values greater than 127.</mal:documentation>

Violations of these defined checks are published using the COM event service.&#xA;The check service allows the consumer to define checks and then link the check definition to a parameter to be monitored. Figure 3-6 shows the nominal sequence of operations for the check service:&#xA;---- check sequence diag ----&#xA;Check service nominal sequence&#xA;A consumer first subscribes for check events before linking some already existing checks to some parameters. The figure shows how check evaluation is normally triggered by either a periodic interval or a change in a monitored value, however, the service also supports the optional ability for consumers to trigger the evaluation of checks using the triggerCheck operation. Finally, if a check event has not been generated for a configurable period of time, known as the maximum reporting interval, an event is generated regardless of whether the check is in violation or not. This maximum reporting interval supports the situation where regular confirmation of the non-violating state of a check is required.&#xA;The list of currently violating checks can be obtained using the getCurrentTransitionList operation; to get a full report including non-violating checks the getSummaryReport operation should be used.&#xA;The following figure (3-7) shows the flow chart for determining the status of a check:&#xA;--- check state diag --- &#xA;Flow Chart for Determining the Status of a Check&#xA;Each time a check is evaluated, the procedure indicated in the flow chart depicted in figure 3-7 is performed to calculate the check result. Each check link can have a condition included which determines whether the check should be applied or not; this allows several checks to be associated to a single parameter and applied in different conditions.&#xA;The service defines five basic check types, constant, reference, delta, limit, and compound. A constant check is used to ensure that a parameter value either does not change or does not change from a set of specific values.&#xA;In the Reference and Delta checks, a value is compared against another value which serves as a reference value. The reference value can be taken from either another parameter or the parameter being checked, and can be the previous value or a value in the past, specified by using a delta time in the ReferenceValue composite. This does not affect the logic of the flow chart above.&#xA;Limit checks monitor parameters to see if the parameter value is either inside or outside a range of values.&#xA;The final check type, compound, monitors a set of previously defined checks and only violates when a specified number of those monitored checks violate themselves.&#xA;The service only publishes check results (as check transition events) when either the result changes from the previous value (for example a check starts to violate), or the maximum reporting interval expires. This reduces the amount of 'no change' reporting data being distributed. For situations where regular reporting of the check result is required, even when no change is detected, a low maximum reporting interval value should be specified.">
      <mal:documentation name="High Level Requirements" order="1">The check service shall provide:
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the capability for reporting the check transitions;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the capability for requesting the latest check transitions;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the capability for controlling the global check evaluation;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the capability for controlling the individual check reporting;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the capability for triggering the evaluation of checks;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the capability for adding check definitions;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the capability for modifying check definitions;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the capability for removing check definitions;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the capability for listing check definitions;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the capability for modifying the association of checks to parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
The check service shall use the event service for issuing the corresponding event generated by the check service.
The check may support the evaluation of the following check types:
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Constant check;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Reference check;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Delta check;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Limit check;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Compound check.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
When performing a limit check, the check service shall:
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;check that the value of a parameter lies within or on a pair of limit values if set to violate outside the range, or outside a pair of limits if set to violate in range;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;declare the check successful when the expression evaluates to true for the correct number of successive valid samples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
When performing a constant check, the check service shall:
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;check that the parameter value evaluates to one of the expected values;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;declare the check successful when the expression evaluates to true for the correct number of successive valid samples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
When performing a referenced check, the check service shall:
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;check that the parameter value evaluates to the referenced value;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;declare the check successful when the expression evaluates to true for the correct number of successive valid samples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
When performing a delta check, the check service shall:
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;calculate the difference, i.e., the delta value, as either an absolute or percentage depending on the check definition between two parameter values;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;check that the difference lies within or on a pair of threshold values if set to violate in range, or outside a pair of thresholds if set to violate outside the range;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;declare the check successful when the expression evaluates to true for the correct number of successive valid samples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
When performing a compound check, the check service shall:
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;monitor the check links referenced by the compound check definition and count the number of referenced checks in violation;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;declare the compound check violated when the number of referenced checks in violation equals or exceeds the defined count value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
The check service shall provide the capability to process several check definitions for the same parameter.
Each check definition shall contain:
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the identifier of the check definition;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the description of the check definition;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the details specific to that check type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
A check definition shall be applied to a specific parameter using a check link.
Each check link shall contain:
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the identifier of the check definition to use;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the identifier of the parameter to monitor;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;a Boolean that controls whether the check is evaluated;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;a Boolean that indicates whether the check should be evaluated when the parameter value changes;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;a Boolean indicating whether the check should apply to the raw or converted value;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the checking interval;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;an optional check validity condition that yielding false prevents the check being performed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Each check validity condition shall contain:
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the identifier of a parameter to use as a validity parameter;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;an expression operator;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;a Boolean indicating whether the expression should apply to the raw or converted value;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;a value to evaluate against.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</mal:documentation>
      <mal:documentation name="Functional Requirements" order="2">Global check evaluation shall be controlled by the enableService operation.
Disabling the check service globally shall pause all check evaluations.
Enabling the check service globally shall resume all check evaluations as they were when they were paused.
The addParameterCheck operation shall be used to create a link between a check definition and the parameter to be checked.
Individual check evaluation shall be controlled by the checkEnabled Boolean value in the CheckLinkDefinition object.
Setting the checkEnabled field to TRUE shall enable check evaluation for a specific CheckLink object.
The checkEnabled value may be set by using the enableCheck operation.
If the checkOnChange value is TRUE, any change in the state (such as validity becoming VALID) or value of a parameter shall cause an evaluation of the parameter value against the check.
If the checkOnChange value is TRUE, any change in the state (such as validity becoming VALID) or the value of the parameter referenced by a check condition shall cause an evaluation of the parameter value against the check.
If a check is required to be evaluated periodically, then the time between these evaluations shall be controlled using the checkInterval Duration value in the CheckLinkDefinition object.
For periodic check evaluations to occur the checkOnChange value must be FALSE, it is not possible to request periodic and change based checking concurrently.
A checkInterval value of '0' shall mean that no periodic check evaluation shall be performed, and checks will be triggered by another mechanism in this case.
The checkInterval value shall only be set when the CheckLinkDefinition object is created.
If a checkInterval or maxReportingInterval that is not supported by the provider is requested (both on creation and update of the check), then an INVALID error shall be returned, and the change shall be rejected.
The check shall be evaluated if the CheckLink object is enabled, the check condition as defined in the check link evaluates to TRUE, and the checked parameter is in a valid state.
The triggerCheck operation shall trigger a check evaluation and immediately publish the result in a CheckTransition event if the check violates.
If the latest CheckResult cannot be determined, for example a getSummaryReport operation call for a CheckLink object that has not been evaluated yet, the associated CheckResult shall contain UNCHECKED for the check states and a checked value of NULL.
In a CheckDefinitionDetails only one of nominalTime and nominalCount is permitted to be zero, an INVALID error shall be returned from the addCheck or updateDefinition operation if this is not the case.
In a CheckDefinitionDetails only one of violationTime and violationCount is permitted to be zero, an INVALID error shall be returned from the addCheck or updateDefinition operation if this is not the case.
If nominalTime is not zero, only when the nominalCount number of valid samples including the current one over a nominalTime time period of the checked parameter have passed the check evaluation shall a new check state and check result be calculated.
If nominalTime is zero, only when the nominalCount number of successive valid samples including the current one of the checked parameter have passed the check evaluation shall a new check state and check result be calculated.
If nominalTime is not zero, but nominalCount is zero, a new check result is always calculated (which then has a new timestamp).
If violationTime is not zero, only when the violationCount number of valid samples including the current one over a violationTime time period of the checked parameter have failed the check evaluation shall a new check state and check result be calculated.
If violationTime is zero, only when the violationCount number of successive valid samples including the current one of the checked parameter have failed the check evaluation shall a new check state and check result be calculated.
If violationTime is not zero, but violationCount is zero, a new check result is always calculated (which then has a new timestamp).
For reference and delta checks it shall be possible to define the check to compare against a reference value.
The reference value checked against shall be updated once validCount samples of that referenced parameter exist at deltaTime in the past from time now.
For a delta check, the delta value shall be calculated as the difference between the reference value and the check parameter and supports both positive and negative deltas.
For percentage based delta thresholds, the percentage is calculated as the arithmetic difference between the parameter value and the reference value, as a percentage of the first valid sample where the result of the calculation equal to 1.0 is interpreted as 100 per cent. For example, if the parameter value is 14 and the reference value is 8 then the calculation is (14 - 8) / 8 or 0.75 or 75%.
For percentage based delta thresholds, if reference value is zero then a divide by zero condition will occur, implementations shall detect this and the calculated delta will be +/- the maximum Float value.
For a constant check, the result of the constant check shall be declared successful only if the parameter value passes evaluation against one of constant values in the definition.
For a compound check, if the minimumChecksInViolation field is greater than '0', the result of the compound check shall be declared successful only if the count of referenced CheckLink objects currently in violation is less than the minimumChecksInViolation field.
For a compound check, if the minimumChecksInViolation field is set to '0', the result of the compound check shall be declared successful if any of the referenced CheckLink objects is nominal i.e. not currently in violation.
If the maxReportingInterval is not zero and if a CheckResult has not been generated in that time a CheckResult with the current check states shall be generated.
The maxReportingInterval value shall be set by using the updateDefinition operation.
Each transition in the state or the result of a check shall cause the generation of a CheckResult and a CheckTransition event.</mal:documentation>

                 comment="The statistic service allows the consumer to monitor and control the statistical evaluation (e.g., average) of parameters.&#xA;The statistic service allows the consumer to link the statistic function to a parameter to be evaluated. Figure 3-9 shows the nominal sequence of operations for the statistic service:&#xA;---- nominal sequence diag ----&#xA;Statistic service nominal sequence&#xA;For each statistics link the service allows a consumer to specify a sampling interval, a reporting interval, and a collection interval. &#xA;The sampling interval defines the interval between samples of the linked parameter, the reporting interval defines the interval between reports of the current statistic evaluation value, and the collection interval defines the period of time which parameter values are collected for the statistic function.&#xA;A consumer can create several links to the same parameter with different intervals, for example for the function 'Mean', a consumer might define two links with different collection intervals, one for an hour (D0) and one for four hours (D1). The consumer might also specify the reporting interval of half an hour for the first link and two hours for the second link. This would mean that the service provider would produce reports as shown in Figure 3-10.&#xA;--- timeline chart ---&#xA;Example Statistic interval reporting&#xA;If a statistic is defined to reset on collection interval expiration the currently calculated value, and any input collection of values, for the parameter being sampled is reset every collection interval, so if an hourly collection interval is defined for the function 'Mean' then every hour the current mean average value is reset (this does not affect the value reported by the Parameter service itself or any other links for the same function and parameter), the set of values used to calculate that mean average is cleared, and a report is generated containing the final value of the function just before the reset.&#xA;If a statistic is defined not to reset every collection interval, then the statistic maintains a moving evaluation for the collection interval. For example, if a collection interval of an hour is defined with a reset Boolean of FALSE for the function 'Maximum' then the evaluation will hold the maximum value obtained in the last hour.&#xA;The consumer is also able to define the sampling interval of the parameter for a link. This is independent of both the collection interval and the reporting interval. It makes sense for the sampling interval to be smaller than both the collection and reporting interval however it is perfectly possible to specify other values, as this is a deployment decision.&#xA;For the statistic service, the list of possible statistics functions is deployment-dependent, as any function would have to be implemented in the service provider. There are no operations for the creation, modification, or deletion of the statistic functions. The statistic service defines the evaluation of minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation functions, however the service supports the addition of other statistical functions by implementations.&#xA;NOTE: To ensure deterministic behaviour, implementations should endeavour to respect Nyquistï¿½s theorem.">
      <mal:documentation name="High Level Requirements" order="1">The statistics service may provide the following capabilities:
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the capability for requesting the current statistics evaluation;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the capability for resetting the statistic evaluations;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the capability for periodic statistics reporting;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the capability to control generation of periodic statistics reporting;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the capability for maintaining the list of evaluated parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
The statistics service may support the evaluation of the following set of statistic functions:
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the maximum value;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the minimum value;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the mean value;&lt;/li&gt;

Whether the statistics reporting service supports a specific statistic function shall be declared when implementing that service.
The statistic service shall maintain a set of links between the statistic function and the parameter that shall be evaluated.
Each statistics link shall contain:
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the identification of the parameter for which statistics are evaluated;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the related collection interval;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;whether the collection resets every collection interval;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the related reporting interval;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the related sampling interval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
The evaluation of a specific statistic shall be reset every collection interval if the reset on collection interval Boolean is TRUE.
The parameter referenced by a statistic link shall be sampled every sampling interval.
The statistics evaluation value shall be reported every reporting and collection interval if generation is enabled.
Each statistics value report shall contain:
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the start time of the evaluation;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the end time of the evaluation;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the time of the collected value if applicable;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the evaluated value;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the number of samples that contributed to the evaluation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
When resetting the statistics, the statistics service shall, in sequence:
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;stop the evaluation of the statistics;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;clear any results accumulated;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;restart the evaluation process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
The statistics service shall provide the capability to enable periodic statistics reporting.
The statistics service shall provide the capability to disable the periodic statistics reporting.
For each valid instruction to disable periodic statistics reporting, the statistics service shall:
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;set the statistics link status to disabled;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;continue evaluating the parameter statistics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</mal:documentation>
      <mal:documentation name="Functional Requirements" order="2">The statistic value for a parameter shall be evaluated after each sampling of the parameter and after the collection interval is elapsed.
A consumer may request the latest status of the statistical evaluations using the getStatistics operation.
If a StatisticLink is required to send periodic reports, then the time between these reports shall be controlled using the reportingInterval duration value.
A reportingInterval value of '0' shall mean no periodic reports shall be sent; reports are required to be triggered by another mechanism in this case.
The reportingInterval value shall be modified using the updateParameterEvaluation operation.
If the reporting interval and the collection intervals align, for example report every minute with a five minute collection interval the fifth minute will align, then only a single report shall be generated in this case.
For onboard parameters the link sampling interval should be a multiple of the minimum sampling interval of those parameters.
If an interval that is not supported by the provider is requested, then an INVALID error shall be returned, and the change rejected.
For the 'Maximum' statistics function, the highest value shall be reported, in the case of multiple samples matching that, the first occurrence shall be report.
For the 'Minimum' statistics function, the smallest value shall be reported, in the case of multiple samples matching that, the first occurrence shall be report.
For the 'Mean average' statistics function, when used with integer parameters the result shall be reported using a Double type.
For the 'Standard deviation' statistics function, when used with integer parameters the result shall be reported using a Double type.</mal:documentation>

                 comment="The aggregation service allows the user to acquire several parameter values in a single request.&#xA;Aggregations are generated either periodically, on an ad-hoc basis, or after a configurable timeout when being filtered. Periodic is where they are generated at a specific generation interval; in this case the periodicity is an aspect of the aggregation rather than the contained parameters. Ad-hoc is when the aggregation generation is triggered by some other deployment-specific mechanism.&#xA;Filtering is where an aggregation is only generated when the change in the value of the filtered parameters exceeds a specified threshold or a timeout is passed. Filtering can be applied to both periodic and ad-hoc aggregations.&#xA;As there may be a large amount of time between reports of an aggregation when filtering is applied, the filtering concept also has a maximum reporting interval. If a report of the aggregation has not passed the filter in the maximum reporting interval a report is generated regardless. This allows there to be regular reports of an aggregation sent regardless of filtering.&#xA;It should be noted that applying a filter with a maximum reporting interval to an ad-hoc aggregation will cause the aggregation to generate reports in a periodic way if the maximum reporting interval is left to expire. This is expected behaviour.&#xA;There are a number of intervals defined in the structures of the service, the diagram in Figure 3-12 illustrates the use of these:&#xA; insert timing diagram &#xA;The diagram shows a single report of an aggregation being generated which contains two parameter sets. Each set of parameter values in the aggregation report contains two optional durations, delta time and interval time. &#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA; &lt;li&gt;The timestamp of the first value of the first set (T1) is defined as the timestamp of the aggregation report plus the delta time of the first set.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA; &lt;li&gt;The timestamp of the second value of the first set (T2) is defined as the timestamp of the first parameter (T1) plus the interval time of the set.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA; &lt;li&gt;The timestamp of the first value of the second set (T3) is defined as the timestamp of the last value of the previous set (T2) plus the delta time of the second set.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA; &lt;li&gt;The timestamp of the second value of the second set (T4) is defined as the timestamp of the first parameter (T3) plus the interval time of the set.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;The COM archive is used to hold the definitions of the aggregations.">
      <mal:documentation name="High Level Requirements" order="1">The aggregation service shall provide:
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the capability for periodic reporting of predefined aggregation values;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the capability for requesting the current value of a set of aggregations;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the capability for controlling reporting of the aggregation values;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the capability for maintaining the list of aggregation definitions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Three modes of generating an aggregation value shall exist: periodic, ad-hoc, and filtered:
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Periodic reports for aggregations shall be generated once for each cycle of a specified interval.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Ad-hoc reports for aggregations shall be triggered by some other deployment-specific means.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Filtered reports for aggregations shall be generated only when the value of one or more parameters in the aggregation has changed by more than a given threshold since the previous generation or when a timeout expires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</mal:documentation>
      <mal:documentation name="Functional Requirements" order="2">The generation of reports for an aggregation shall be controlled by the generationEnabled Boolean value in the AggregationDefinitionDetails structure.
Setting the generationEnabled field to TRUE shall enable generation of reports for a specific aggregation.
The generationEnabled values can be set by using the enableGeneration operation.
The filtering of reports for an aggregation shall be controlled by the filterEnabled Boolean value in the AggregationDefinitionDetails structure.
Setting the filterEnabled field to TRUE shall enable filtering of reports for a specific aggregation.
The filterEnabled values can be set by using the enableFilter operation.
If an aggregation is required to send periodic reports, then the time between these reports shall be controlled using the reportInterval Duration value in the AggregationDefinitionDetails structure.
Periodic reports for aggregations shall set the generationMode field of the AggregationValueInstance to PERIODIC.
No periodic reports shall be generated when the reportInterval field is set to '0' and reports will be triggered by another ad-hoc implementation-specific mechanism in this case.
Ad-hoc reports for aggregations shall set the generationMode field of the AggregationValueInstance to ADHOC.
If an aggregation is filtered, reports shall be generated only when the value of one or more parameters in the aggregation have changed by more than a given threshold since the previous generated aggregation report.
The threshold for the filter shall be defined, on a per-parameter basis, either as a percentage or an (absolute) delta change in value.
Parameters in an aggregation that do not have a filter specified in the aggregation definition shall be ignored by the filter comparison process.
If filtering is enabled and a filtered timeout has been set for that aggregation, if no change has been detected in that time-out period, an aggregation value shall be generated with a generation mode of FILTERED_TIMEOUT. This measure ensures that extensive periods of time do not elapse without reports of an enabled aggregation.
The generationEnabled, filterEnabled, filteredTimeout, sendUnchanged and reportInterval values of an AggregationDefinition object can be set by using the updateDefinition operation.
If the filteredTimeout interval, reportInterval or one or more of the sampleIntervals requested are not supported by the provider then an INVALID error shall be returned and the creation or change rejected.
If the sendUnchanged field in the AggregationDefinition object is FALSE then parameter values that have not changed since the previous report shall be replaced by a NULL in the values list of the AggregationSetValue composite.
The ordering of the values in the AggregationValueInstance object shall match the ordering of parameters in the AggregationDefinitionDetails structure.</mal:documentation>
