Developing and debugging the NMF under Netbeans

Getting started
---------------
Netbeans is a recommended IDE to use with the NMF as it definitely works out of the box.
To import your NMF distribution into the IDE, select `File -> Open Project` and select the NMF
root directory that you cloned from GitHub. Netbeans will now import all Maven subprojects into the Netbeans workspace.

Setting up the supervisor with simulator
----------------------------------------
Right click the project **ESA NMF Core Composite - NanoSat MO Supervisor** and select the option **Properties**.
In the options **Run** enter the path to the supervisor simulator environment (by default at **sdk/sdk-package/target/nmf-sdk-2.1.0-SNAPSHOT/home/nmf/nanosat-mo-supervisor-sim**). Then add the following line under VM Options and save the configuration.

:code:`-Dnmf.platform.impl=esa.mo.platform.impl.util.PlatformServicesProviderSoftSim`

Setting up the CTT
------------------
Right click the project **ESA NMF SDK Tool - Consumer Test Tool (CTT)** and select the option **Properties**.
In the options **Run** enter the path to the CTT execution environment (by default at **sdk/sdk-package/target/nmf-sdk-2.1.0-SNAPSHOT/home/nmf/consumer-test-tool**) and save the configuration.

You are now able to start the supervisor with simulator and the CTT from NetBeans by right-clicking the respective project and selecting **Run**.
You can now look at :doc:`apps/apps`.


NMF Space Apps
------------------

Set the working directory of the application to a newly created directory containing:

- provider.properties file (available in [sdk-package space-app-root](sdk-package/src/main/resources/space-app-root) directory)
- settings.properties and transport.properties files (available in [sdk-package space-common](sdk-package/src/main/resources/space-common) directory)

The above files are also deployed into all home directories of Space Apps inside an assembled SDK package.

Specify the URI of a running Supervisor's Directory Service, so the app can connect to it and consume Platform Services provided by the Supervisor:

- In Netbeans, Right Click on a project (e.g. 'ESA NMF SDK App Example - All MC services')->Properties->Run, and set the VM Options to:
- :code:`-Desa.mo.nmf.centralDirectoryURI=<Directory_Service_URI>`
- e.g. :code:`-Desa.mo.nmf.centralDirectoryURI=maltcp://123.123.123.123:1024/nanosat-mo-supervisor-Directory`

NMF Ground Applications
------------------------

Set the working directory of the application to a newly created directory containing:

- consumer.properties file (available in [sdk-package ground-consumer-root](sdk-package/src/main/resources/ground-consumer-root) directory)
- providerURIs.properties file (generated by a running provider application)

The providerURIs.properties file is not needed by CTT as it retrieves these from Common::Directory service using its URI, input by the user.
