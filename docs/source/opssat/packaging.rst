Packaging your app for deployment on OPS-SAT

Packaging your app for testing on the ground is slightly different from testing your app on a satellite or a flat-sat.
In this tutorial you will learn how to package your app for deployment on OPS-SAT or get it ready for flat-sat tests.

Note: This does not produce an actual package, but only the file tree required to generate a package.
The actual IPK for OPS-SAT testing and operations is generated by ESA for security and auditing reasons.
The operational IPK generation instructions can be found under https://opssat1.esoc.esa.int/projects/experimenter-information/wiki/Building_and_submitting_your_application_to_ESOC (you have to be registered as an OPS-SAT experimenter)

Getting the right files
-----------------------
In short, you will need to: clone a repository, change some configuration files, run maven to generate the directory structure, and zip that directory. So, let's jump into it!

1. Clone the `NMF Mission OPS-SAT repository <https://github.com/esa/nmf-mission-ops-sat>`_.
2. Checkout the ``dev`` branch to get the latest version.
3. Ensure your local maven repository has the latest NMF Core and NMF Mission OPS-SAT artifacts by running ``mvn install`` in both NMF Core and and NMF Mission OPS-SAT repository clones.
4. Ensure your local maven repository has the latest artifacts of your application by running ``mvn install`` in your application project.
5. Open the ``pom.xml`` file in the ``opssat-package/experiment`` directory.
6. In the properties, edit your experimenter ID ``expId``, ``expApid`` (typically APID equals to sum of ``expId + 1024``), and the Maven information for your app. Make sure that ``expVersion`` matches the version defined in your app's POM.

.. code-block:: xml
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 4,5,6,7,13,14

    <properties>
      <!-- Change the following 4 properties to match the information of your app -->
      <!-- The declared version is arbitrary and does not have to match the NMF version, but only the app version -->
      <expId>000</expId>
      <expApid>1024</expApid>
      <expMainClass>esa.mo.nmf.apps.PayloadsTestApp</expMainClass>
      <expVersion>2.1.0-SNAPSHOT</expVersion>
      <!-- Do not change the following -->
      <esa.nmf.mission.opssat.assembly.outputdir>${project.build.directory}/experiment-package</esa.nmf.mission.opssat.assembly.outputdir>
    </properties>
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>int.esa.nmf.sdk.examples.space</groupId>
        <artifactId>payloads-test</artifactId>
        <version>${expVersion}</version>
      </dependency>
    </dependencies>

7. In the default ``artifactItems`` configuration of the ``expLib`` execution of the ``maven-dependency-plugin`` inside the you need to change the Maven qualifiers to match those of your app once again. You must also add an ``artifactItem`` for each external dependency that you app has.

.. code-block:: xml
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 4,5,13,14,15

   <artifactItems>
      <artifactItem>
        <!-- Change the following 3 properties to locate JAR your app needs -->
        <groupId>int.esa.nmf.sdk.examples.space</groupId>
        <artifactId>payloads-test</artifactId>
        <version>${expVersion}</version>
        <!-- Do not change the following -->
        <type>jar</type>
        <overWrite>true</overWrite>
        <outputDirectory>${esa.nmf.mission.opssat.assembly.outputdir}/home/exp${expId}/lib/</outputDirectory>
      </artifactItem>
      <artifactItem>
        <groupId>com.example</groupId>
        <artifactId>your_dependency</artifactId>
        <version>x.x.x</version>
        <type>jar</type>
        <overWrite>true</overWrite>
        <outputDirectory>${esa.nmf.mission.opssat.assembly.outputdir}/home/exp${expId}/lib/</outputDirectory>
      </artifactItem>
    <artifactItems>

8. You can also add additional copy tasks to package additional files that your app requires by editing ``ant_copy_jobs.xml`` file.  These copy tasks will be executed by the ``Maven AntRun Plugin``.

9. Invoke ``mvn clean package`` in the ``opssat-package/experiment`` directory.

10. Go to the folder ``target/experiment-package/`` and you will find the directory structure to package your app as an IPK for OPS-SAT.

11. Zip the generated directory structure and send it to OPS-SAT's Flight Control Team (FCT) by following the guide instructions in: https://opssat1.esoc.esa.int/projects/experimenter-information/wiki/Building_and_submitting_your_application_to_ESOC
