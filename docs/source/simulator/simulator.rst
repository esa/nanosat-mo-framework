The NMF comes with a simulator tailored for the `OPS-SAT <https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/OPS-SAT>`_.
This simulator is for example used, when you start the Nanosat MO Supervisor with simulator, like we did in the :doc:`../eclipse` and :doc:`../netbeans` tutorials.
The simulator provides us with all kinds of data, ranging from basic telemetry, like system time, to GPS and ADCS information.
The simulator is the first instance that you can use to test your app with data which is as close to the real thing as possible.

As a static simulator is pretty boring, you can take a look at :doc:`configure`.
