Welcome to Nanosat MO Framework's documentation!
================================================
This is the documentation page for the `Nanosat MO Framework <https://github.com/esa/nanosat-mo-framework>`_.
You can use this framework to develop on-board and ground software for nanosatellites. 
If your're new here, make sure to check out the :doc:`quickstart` page.
Following this page will lead you to having your own app which you could run on a satellite (like `OPS-SAT <https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/OPS-SAT>`_).
You can also just click through the different pages to see what we can offer.
