## NanoSat MO Framework - Mission - Simulator

The simulator contains a set of libraries and tools capable of simulating
most of the spacecraft functionalities available through the NMF.

This project is also an example implementation of mission-specific components of the NMF.

The simulator platform is based on OPS-SAT mission.

### Repository content
