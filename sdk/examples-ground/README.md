Demos of NMF Apps
============

The source code examples include a package containing a set of demos with NMF Ground applications. These demos are very simple applications which can be used by the developers as models. The following NMF Ground application demos are available:
* Ground Zero
* Ground with Directory service
* Ground Set and Command
* Ground Facebook

Each one of these NMF Ground applications has a different functionality and it is intended to demonstrate something different. For example, the Ground Zero application demonstrates how to establish the connection to a provider and how a simple adapter can be submitted in order to receive parameter values.
